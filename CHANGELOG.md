# Changelog

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/emilsvennesson/vibecast/releases/tag/v0.1.0) (2026-07-09)

Initial release of **vibecast** — a native Google Cast receiver written in Rust
that turns any computer into a Chromecast.

### Features

* Full CastV2 TLS protocol: device authentication, heartbeat, and the receiver
  namespace.
* Advertises as a Chromecast over mDNS and the eureka `/setup/eureka_info`
  HTTP/HTTPS endpoints.
* **Per-player receivers** — each connected player (browser Shaka page, Kodi
  add-on, native frontend) registers its capabilities and gets its own dedicated
  Cast device advertising that player's real DRM systems, codecs, resolution,
  HDR, and HDCP.
* Embedded Shaka Player bridge over HTTP/WebSocket with DRM license and
  DASH/HLS manifest proxying + normalization.
* Bundled apps: SVT Play, TV4 Play, Viaplay, and Prime Video.
* Desktop server (the `vibecast` CLI, Linux/macOS) and a native Android TV
  frontend via a UniFFI facade.
* Kodi add-on client for boxes that prefer Kodi's player.

### Artifacts

* Linux binaries (`x86_64`, `aarch64`) and a macOS binary (Apple Silicon).
* Multi-arch container image on GHCR (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`).
* Signed Android APK.
* Homebrew formula (`brew install emilsvennesson/vibecast/vibecast`).
